    approx_upper_bound(adj_list::AdjList, nb_cars::Int)

Approximately calculates the upper bound of the distance traveled by `nb_cars` cars in a given `adj_list` of streets.

# Arguments
- `adj_list::AdjList`: The adjacency list representation of the street network.
- `nb_cars::Int`: The number of cars.

# Returns
- `distance::Int`: The approximate upper bound of the total distance traveled by the cars.
